This article offers a thorough overview of backpropagation, a key technique in machine learning. It begins with a clear explanation of backpropagation and its significance in AI development. The article then discusses the mechanics of backpropagation, highlighting its advantages, such as enhanced learning efficiency, while also addressing its limitations. It provides detailed instructions on setting up neural networks, with a focus on forward propagation, and concludes with a guide on calculating deltas and updating network weights to optimize the learning process.\

Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) are the most basic type of neural network, where each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. These networks are typically used for tasks involving tabular data, text processing, and other applications where spatial or sequential structure is not crucial. FCNs are essential components of deep learning models and can serve as building blocks for more complex architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).}
