SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 2:
The Basics 
	1	What is Version Control?
	◦	Version control systems (VCS) act as databases to save snapshots of a project at any time.
	◦	They allow viewing and comparing different versions of a project, supporting various types of projects like websites, design projects, and apps.
	◦	VCS is distinct from backup or deployment systems and integrates seamlessly with existing tools.
	2	Why Use a Version Control System?
	◦	Collaboration: Ensures multiple team members can work on files simultaneously without conflicts, avoiding errors from manual coordination.
	◦	Storing Versions Properly: Keeps all project versions and changes organized without the need for cumbersome naming schemes or manual documentation.
	◦	Restoring Previous Versions: Allows easy reversion to previous states, reducing the risk of permanent mistakes.
	◦	Understanding What Happened: Provides a history of changes with descriptions, aiding in project tracking and understanding.
	◦	Backup: Acts as a backup system where each team member's repository contains the full project history.
